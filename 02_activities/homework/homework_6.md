**Write**: Reflect on your previous work and how you would adjust to include ethics and inequity components. Total length should be a few paragraphs, no more than one page.

In one of my previous jobs, my team worked closely with customers helping them with their internal design. An ethical question arises is how much information can be shared since we often work with customers who are in direct competition of each other. As we learn tips and tricks while working with one customer, it is often we want to share the same info with other customers. One approach could be to silo all teams working with competing customers until each project has been completed.

Another experience I have related to ethics and inequity is being part of the hiring process. Gender and racial bias is always a concern in the tech industry. Some ideas worth exploring includes anonymize applicants during different phases of the interview process. For example removal of the applicant's name in his/her resume when the resuming is passed to hiring teams is probably a good and simple idea to implement.
